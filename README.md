# aws-generic-templates
Developed by Sachin Singh Bhadauria

These are generaic templates and their Input files to create different stacks in aws like Secutrity group, ELB , ASG

Below are few assumptioms which I made while creating this readme file :
1) Region you are using is us-east-1
2) Already connected to your account through CLI prior to execute these commands
3) You are familiar with terminology used in aws
4) The information provided in this Repository/Templates and on this subject are for reference only.If you have any difficulties  or issues please refer to AWS Support.

Stacks -- Please use examples below to run from CLI to create different stacks
-----------------

Security Groups Stack:

    aws --region us-east-1 cloudformation create-stack --stack-name security-group-cf --template-body file://aws-generic-templates/security_group/sg-stack.json

ELB Stack:

    aws  --region us-east-1 cloudformation create-stack --template-body  file://aws-generic-templates/elb/elb.json --cli-input-json file://aws-generic-templates/elb/input-elb.json

ASG / LC Stack:

    aws  --region us-east-1 cloudformation create-stack --template-body  file://aws-generic-templates/asg-lc/asg-lc.json --cli-input-json file://aws-generic-templates/asg-lc/input-asg-lc.json

RDS Stack:

    aws  --region us-east-1 cloudformation create-stack --template-body  file://aws-generic-templates/rds/oracle_template.json  --cli-input-json file://aws-generic-templates/rds/input-oracle.json


During ASG/LC Cloudformation stack you may need to deal with userdata option also, as these are generic templates I will make them available as a seperate rpository to use later. But you can anytime use your userdata while creating asl-lc stack as our end goal is to make an ec2 which is capabele of handling certain tasks for us and that is achieved through passing userdata along with that.
